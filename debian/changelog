kwin (4:5.8.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (5.8.7)
      + move the view at the correct index at startup
        using the same trick as elsewhere, set the currentIndex
        and move the view to currentIndex right at startup
        the only way to be sure is onContentHeightChanged
        as there are no signals for when "the view has been
        populated and settled up"
      + [kcm_kwindecoration] Respect theme colors in buttons
      + Fix crash on dragging titlebar buttons in System Settings
        Currently, if user tries to move one of buttons to the left, ending up
        dragging one button onto another, crash occurs.
        In addition, this patch replaces verbose replacement(remove/insert) with
        more elegant QVector<T>::move(int, int)
        Fixes KDE#374153
      + [platforms/drm] Explicitly request event context version 2
        Libdrm 2.4.78 introduces a version 2 and if KWin gets built against it
        our code would break. Given that this change is for Plasma/5.8 branch.
        (https://phabricator.kde.org/T5839)
      + Fix KWin decoration KCM showing correct index at startup
        The KCM has a context property of the currently set theme index. This is
        set before the decorations model is populated, so it is currently always
        -1.
        This model is populated after the constructor but before
        KCModule::load().
        KCModule::load is called from KCModule::showEvent so before
        QQuickGridView will start doing anything with delegates.
        This fixes the problem simply and also avoid parsing the config file
        multiple times.
        This bug was introduced in 5.9.4:
        Someone made a (tested) change to make sure the view scrolled to the
        right place on startup.
        I then made a (tested) commit fixing the crash on exit
        The author then updated his patch to my changes, but now in a way that
        didn't work.
      + Sort the themes in decoration KCM
        Even though we're using a QSortFilterProxy model, by default it doesn't
        actually sort anything until instructed to.
        This patch turns sorting on.
      + Improve the x11 timestamp handling
        So far KWin only updated the x11 timestamp if the new timestamp is larger
        than the existing one. While this is a useful thing it creates problems
        when the 32 bit msec based time stamp wraps around which happens after
        running an X server for 49 days. After the timestamp wrapped around KWin
        would not update the timestamp any more and thus some calls might fail.
        Most prominent victims are keyboard and pointer grab which fails as the
        timestamp is either larger than the server timestamp or smaller than the
        last grab timestamp.
        Another problem related to timestamp handling is KWin getting broken by
        wrong timestamps sent by applications. A prominent example is clusterssh
        which used to send a timestamp as unix time which is larger than the
        x timestamp and thus our timestamp gets too large.
        This change addresses these problems by allowing to reset the timestamp.
        This is only used from updateXTime (which is normally invoked before we
        do things like grabKeyboard). Thus we make QX11Info::getTimestamp the
        ultimate trusted source for timestamps.
        Fixes KDE#377901 KDE#348569
      + Fix regression for timestamp handling for Xwayland windows
        Change 0bec9ad7337536e319c17c5684d97e1156399fdb introduced a regrssion
        on Wayland. On Wayland getTimestamp always returns 0, thus the X11
        timestamp gets reset again and again. This results in broken interaction
        for Xwayland windows as the broken unit tests show.
        This change addresses the regression by ignoring a value of 0.
        It means the addressed bug is still present on Wayland for X11 windows
        as the timestamp doesn't get updated properly. This requires further
        changes.
      + fix occassional crash caused by needlessly delayed signals (bko#363224)
        As pointed out by the Valgrind trace in #363224, delaying the signal causes
        the EffectWindow* argument to become invalid before the connected slot is
        called (this is because Qt discards only delayed signal->slot calls where
        the receiver gets deleted meanwhile, not the sender and definitely not
        a random argument.
        If the supposed glitches really happen, they should get fixed correctly,
        and for all cases (I doubt only desktop number would be involved but
        not e.g. shaded or minimized states).
