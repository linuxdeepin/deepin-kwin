/**
 * @brief Singleton class to handle the various focus chains.
 *
 * A focus chain is a list of Clients containing information on which Client should be activated.
 *
 * Internally this FocusChain holds multiple independent chains. There is one chain of most recently
 * used Clients which is primarily used by TabBox to build up the list of Clients for navigation.
 * The chains are organized as a normal QList of Clients with the most recently used Client being the
 * last item of the list, that is a LIFO like structure.
 *
 * In addition there is one chain for each virtual desktop which is used to determine which Client
 * should get activated when the user switches to another virtual desktop.
 *
 * Furthermore this class contains various helper methods for the two different kind of chains.
