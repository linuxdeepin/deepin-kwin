 * @brief Menu shown for a Client.
 *
 * The UserActionsMenu implements the Menu which is shown on:
 * @li context-menu event on Window decoration
 * @li window menu button
 * @li Keyboard Shortcut (by default Alt+F3)
 *
 * The menu contains various window management related actions for the Client the menu is opened
 * for, this is normally the active Client.
 *
 * The menu which is shown is tried to be as close as possible to the menu implemented in
 * libtaskmanager, though there are differences as there are some actions only the window manager
 * can provide and on the other hand the libtaskmanager cares also about things like e.g. grouping.
 *
 * Whenever the menu is changed it should be tried to also adjust the menu in libtaskmanager.
