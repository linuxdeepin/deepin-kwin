/**
 * @brief Resource representing a wl_surface.
 *
 * The SurfaceInterface gets created by the CompositorInterface. A SurfaceInterface normally
 * takes up a role by being "attached" to either a ShellSurfaceInterface, a SubSurfaceInterface
 * or a Cursor.
 *
 * The implementation of the SurfaceInterface does not only wrap the features exposed by wl_surface,
 * but goes further by integrating the information added to a SurfaceInterface by other interfaces.
 * This should make interacting from the server easier, it only needs to monitor the SurfaceInterface
 * and does not need to track each specific interface.
 *
 * The SurfaceInterface takes care of reference/unreferencing the ClientBuffer attached to it.
 * As long as a ClientBuffer is attached, the released signal won't be sent. If the ClientBuffer
 * is no longer needed by the SurfaceInterface, it will get unreferenced and might be automatically
 * deleted (if it's no longer referenced).
 *

 * @see ClientBuffer
 * @see SubSurfaceInterface
 * @see BlurInterface
 * @see ContrastInterface
 * @see ShadowInterface
